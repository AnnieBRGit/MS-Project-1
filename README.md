## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**First Time Visitor Goals**
-   I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
	Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a hero image, logo and a readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. 
	The main website concept (i.e it’s a gym) is made clear with the hero image
	The user has two options: Click the navigation buttons, or scroll down the page, to learn more about the company, or its products and services.
-	I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
	The site has been designed to be fluid and easy to navigate. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar (same on each page, with same navigation bar), each navbar describes where the user will end up upon clicking the item.
	At the bottom of the all pages is a footer (same on each page), which acts as an anchor when the user has scrolled down the page. 
-	I want to get a quick understanding of what the company offers in relation to the services or products available to me as a returning or potential new customer. Links to company social media sites at the bottom of the footer can provide me additional resources for testimonials, pictures or information from other users. 
	When a new visitor has read the contents of “Home” and “Gym”-sections, they are prompted to visit “Contact Us” section to contact the company, if they wish to receive a free first instructor-lead training session at the gym. 
	Contact Us page provides a form for contacting, address and email to the gym, and at the footer there is contact details to social media sites. 

**Returning Visitor Goals**
-	I want to find information about the schedule. 
	Schedule is shown on the “Home” page.
-	I want to view contact details easily.
	“Contact Us" page is easily available on top of each page, on the navigation bar.
	“Contact Us” page includes email and visiting address to the gym, along with a Google Map. 
	The footer contains links to the company’s social media sites.
-	I want to find inspirational images in the Gallery-section.
	“Gallery” page contains inspirational images of existing customers training at the gym.

**Frequent User Goals**
-	I would like to visit the site to check if any new training sessions, products or services have been added. 
	The user would be comfortable with the layout and can easily find summary information on “Home” page. 
- 	I would like to see if there are any new pictures in the gallery.
	The user, being comfortable with the website layout can click “Gallery”

**Further Testing**
-	The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers, and seems to be working fine.
-	The website was viewed on devices such as Desktop (various sizes), Laptops (Dell and HP), iPhone7 and iPhoneX. Ipod test showed a blank white space at the bottom of Gym page, issue rectified.
-	The linking between pages (navigation bar) was tested multiple times with different devices to ensure functionality.  
-	Family members and colleagues were asked to review the site for functionality, layout and user experience issues.

**Known Bugs**
-	When viewed on desktop devices the previous hero image was low quality, image changed for high-resolution image to ensure quality and proper display.  
-	Navbar: considered fixed-top navbar for UX purposes. I feel the fixed-top navbar is too “heavy” and is distracting, changed to sicky-top navbar which disappears in after middle part, possibly due to short scrolling (not a lot of content on webpage). Fixed-top navbar could work if colour changes to match overall background colour. 
-	Contact.html file: row 94. Map and form align equally only when “row” element used after col-12 element.
