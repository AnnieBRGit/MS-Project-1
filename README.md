Further Testing
•	The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers, and seems to be working fine.
•	The website was viewed on devices such as Desktop (various sizes), Laptops (Dell and HP), iPhone7 and iPhoneX.
•	The linking between pages (navigation bar) was tested multiple times with different devices to ensure functionality.  
•	Family members and colleagues were asked to review the site for functionality, layout and user experience issues.

Known Bugs
•	On desktop devices the hero image is rather large, image could be resized for user (UX) preferences and best practices? 
•	Navbar: considered fixed-top navbar for UX purposes. I feel the fixed-top navbar is too “heavy” and is distracting, changed to sicky-top navbar which disappears in after middle part, possibly due to short scrolling (not a lot of content on webpage”. Fixed-top navbar could work if colour changes to match overall background colour.
